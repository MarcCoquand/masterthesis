In the previous chapters we introduced software quality and established why it
is important for software engineers. There exists different metrics for
measuring software quality. One of them is measuring the Lines of Code (LOC) in
the software as a measure of defects.~\cite{} As this study will measure
different programming languages and software paradigms where syntax is vastly
different, it follows that using LOC to measure if one paradigm is potentially
flawed.~\cite{defectloc} Thus another metric to look at is cyclomatic
complexity.

Research conducted on the effect of programming languages found a slightly lower
cyclomatic complexity for functional programs over imperative
programs.\cite{bergklaas} The research did not answer however how the choice of
architecture and design patterns affect this number.
