\chapter{Introduction: Software paradigms and complexity}

Different schools of thoughts have different approaches when it comes to
building applications. There is one that is the traditional, object oriented,
procedural way of doing it. Then there is a contender, a functional approach, as
an alternative way to build applications. 


 When building applications testability
is of high concern to ensure that the application functions properly. By looking
at cyclomatic complexity, described in Section~\ref{cyclomaticcomplexity}, we
can find out how the different approaches affect the amount of tests we need to
write to get full branch coverage. By looking at the cognitive dimensions,
described in Section~\ref{cognitivedimensions}, we can find how the two
approaches affect the mental complexity for the developer. So by looking at
different case studies this study aims to find if the different software
paradigms affect the testability and if there are any cognitive benefits to one
approach over the other.
