\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Different schools of thoughts have different approaches when it comes to
building applications. There is one that is the traditional, object oriented,
procedural way of doing it. Then there is a contender, a functional approach, as
an alternative way to build applications. Functional programming originates from
1936 from Lambda calculus~\cite{Turner} and even though functional programming
is old, the industry most commonly use Object-oriented, imperative, languages
such as Java. (ADD\_REFERENCE usage statistics) As of today, defects in software
are still common place with the average defect rate being 15- 50 per 10000 lines
of code.~\cite{McConnell:2004:CCS:1096143} This indicates that the tools used
might be inefficient and improvements can be made. Also with defects being so
common engineers partly not only need new tools that decrease defects but also
need to ensure that for future developers the code is easy to modify so that
when defects show up they can easily be fixed. The software needs to be
maintainble to be of good quality.

Software quality can be divided into two different subparts: software functional
quality and software structural quality.~\cite{Pressman:2004:SEP:994110}
Software functional quality reflects how well our system conforms to given
functional requirements or specification and the degree of which we produce
correct software.  To check that the software is correct, software engineers
create tests. In order to create tests, the engineer employs various patterns
and tools in the code to make the code easier to test, such as Object-oriented
programming. They can also use static analysis and logical proofs to ensure
correctness. 

Software structural quality refers to how well the software adheres to
non-functional requirements such as robustness and
maintainability.~\cite{Pressman:2004:SEP:994110} Some of the maintainability
aspects, such as readability, is hard to measure quantitatively. By performing
semi-structured interviews, it is possible to investigate how well the code is
understood. 

In this thesis, the focus will be on Functional programming as a potential
solution to increase software quality. The aim is to investigate what makes
software maintainable and can those criterias that make software maintainable be
enforced and with Functional programming.Since functional programming is not the
most popular approach to software engineering today, it is worth taking into
consideration how employing functional programming might affect the readability
and maintainability of the software. If no one understands the code, how can
they maintain the software?  Since software engineering is so general the focus
will be specifically on servers. In servers, it is common to use a protocol
called REST to establish communication between servers and
clients.(ADD\_REFERENCE REST)  These servers are called RESTful APIs and will be
explained further in Chapter~\ref{background}.  As of today, it is up to the
developer to manually ensure that this protocol is followed. Nothing enforces
the developer to do it correctly unless the library implementation enforces it.
Popular frameworks, such as Express, however do not enforce this protocol.

This thesis will show that it is possible using Functional programming to
implement a server library that forces the user to make REST compliant servers.
By enforcing that compliancy, it would aid developers in improving the software
functional quality. By establishing the rules in Object-oriented programming
for maintainable software and translating those to functional programming and by
evaluating the readability of code written using the library, the study aims to
find how software structural quality is affected through the use of functional
programming.
